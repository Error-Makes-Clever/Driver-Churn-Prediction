## 📈 Exploratory Data Insights

### 👤 Demographics
- **Majority drivers** aged 28–38 (right-skewed).
- Gender & education level → **minimal impact on churn**.
- **Most churners** joined with **Designation 1**.

### 💰 Income & Business Value
- Avg income ₹40k–₹70k, skewed distribution.
- **Income growth = retention** (Only 43 got raises!).
- High total business value → **less likely to churn**.

### ⏳ Tenure & Rating
- Short-tenure drivers churn more.
- Ratings of **1 or 2 → high churn**; **no drivers rated 5**.
- High **grade (4,5)** → better performance & retention.

### 🏙️ City Insights
- **C13** has highest churn rate (>80%); **C29** has lowest.
- **C17** shows performance drop, **C29** improves steadily.
- City-wise churn & performance help **target retention** strategies.

## 🔍 Key Business Insights

- **Top churn factors**: Low performance rating, no income/rating growth, short tenure.
- **Tenure**, **total business value**, and **Quarterly Rating** are **strong negative churn indicators**.
- **Cities C13, C17, and C2** need urgent churn-reduction strategies.
- **High-grade, high-income drivers** must be prioritized for **retention efforts**.
- **Income and rating improvements** → highly associated with lower churn.
